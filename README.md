py1.py is a function converts gray-scale image into binary image.

py2.py uses sequential labeling algorithm to segment the images.

py3.py takes a labeled image and computes object attributes, and generates the objects database using Position, Orientation, Roundness and Template_size those four attributes.

py4.py recognizes objects from the generated databases. P.S. The input image should be labeled image generated by py2.py.

py5.py uses 3*3 sobel opreator to detect the edges of the images. And the outer layer of the image is ingored in this opreation.

py6.py first using threshold get obvious edge then do hough transformation. It returns edge_thresh_image and hough_image.

Py7.py draw infinite lines on strong lines returned by py6.py.

py8.py draw segemented lines correspond to the strong edges. Using sign of first derivates to determine the start point and end point of an edge.

test_objects.py is the driver for functions 1-4. Need to change the input images names to run.

test_line_finder.py is the driver for functions 5-8. Need to change the input images names to run.
